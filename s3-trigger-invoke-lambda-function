In this tutorial, you use the console to create a Lambda function and configure a trigger for an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. 
Every time that you add an object to your Amazon S3 bucket, your function runs and outputs the object type to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

lambda_function:

        import json
        import urllib.parse
        import boto3
        
        print('Loading function')
        
        s3 = boto3.client('s3')
        
        
        def lambda_handler(event, context):
            #print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
        
            # Get the object from the event and show its content type
            bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
            key = urllib.parse.unquote_plus(event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key'], encoding='utf-8')
            try:
                response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
                print("CONTENT TYPE: " + response['ContentType'])
                return response['ContentType']
            except Exception as e:
                print(e)
                print('Error getting object {} from bucket {}. Make sure they exist and your bucket is in the same region as this function.'.format(key, bucket))
                raise e
